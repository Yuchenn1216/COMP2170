# COMP2170 Applied Statistics Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project conducts statistical analysis on hotel energy efficiency data and brand recognition in movies, developed as part of STAT2170/6180 at Macquarie University. The implementation focuses on statistical modeling, data visualization, and reproducible research practices.

## Analysis Components
### Hotel Energy Efficiency Analysis

Correlation analysis and data visualization
Model validation and selection
F-test for overall regression
R² and adjusted R² analysis

### Brand Recognition Study

Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
Statistical hypothesis testing
Study of interaction effects between variables
Model assumption validation
